# Password Generator Starter Code

## Holy Cuss this was a pain but I finally did it.
 I learned so much though and it was honestly so rewarding when it finally starting working.
 So this application will generate a password containing the set(s) of characters you choose at any length you
 choose between 8 and 128.
 
 
 ### I have no clue why this link isn't working and just sends you to this readme... I can't figure out what's wrong.
